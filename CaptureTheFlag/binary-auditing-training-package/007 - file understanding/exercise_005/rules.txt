Yes ! The file you downloaded isn't corrupt :) There's only one dll, a bmp and this text in the zip !
Your goal is to create a loader for that dll. But it's not that easy :)


GOALS :


1/ The dll will display a MessageBox with the text "Yes, you made it work !  Cool !". Exactly that text, of course without the quotes :)
2/ You will create a DIALOGBOX (not a window :), and the dll will insert the bitmap (itworks.bmp) in it.
3/ You can't touch a single bit of my dll


Then everything is up to you :)

HINT: You can retreive the hwnd of an item in a dialogbox with the api GetDlgItem, then you can use it as a window hwnd :)
