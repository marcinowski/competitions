This one is a bit different.  It contains a .dll that has three functions. 
The first two are exported and the third is called from the second, 
but we wunt it to be called when the 'Third Function' button is pressed 
instead of when from the second funtion.  This might be a bit difficult, 
but im sure a few people will be up for the challenge. 

Good luck and have fun.  

Here are the rules :
1. You must add an exported function to the dll.
2. You must add an import to the exe.
3. You must do it all manually!!
4. No programs that help in the adding/removing of imports/exports!
5. Have Fun :)
