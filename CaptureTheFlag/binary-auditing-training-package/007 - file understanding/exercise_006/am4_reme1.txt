The goal here will be to learn something
about the format of the resources section (.rsrc) of a windows PE file.

* The Challenge
***************************

Attached in the zip file you will find 3 .dump files. These files are the actual
hex/binary data for 2 dialogs and an icon. This is the raw data for 3 seperate 
resources. Your goal is to add a new section called .rsrc and insert these resources
into the exe file. This will involve building a valid rsrc structure in the new section,
and adding the provided data as the actual data pointed to by the leaf nodes.
Then change the program to pop up the dialog1.dump dialog first, followed by the 
dialog2.dump dialog next. For each dialog, make the title bar display the added
icon in the .rsrc section. 

Currently the program just exits immediately.

Here are the rules: 

1) You MUST!!!! do all the work in the .rsrc by hand. No using resource editors to do this.
   Remember you're supposed to learn about the structure of this section.
2) You can use any other tools you wish, except a resource editor, to perform the adding of the 
   section or adding code. etc...
