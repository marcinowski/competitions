As you've maybe allready noticed when you try to run the ReMe it
crashes with an int3 ;)
Don't worry about it... it's supposed to...

I've taken this idea from SantMat's ReMe 3, i hope he don't mind ;)
Let me make the rules clear to you:

1.	Make a new Section.
2.	Don't touch the other 2 Sections (offcourse you may touch the
	PE Header ;)
3.	You MUST use the allready Imported ExitProcess to quit this
	program in a clean way :)
4.	Make the Entry Point jump to your Code BUT... after your Code
	make it jump to the Original Entry Point and let it quit
	in a good way with the Imported ExitProcess ;)
5.	In your Code make an Message Box that shows the current Tick
	Count...
6.	And offcourse do it all Manually, no Tools (You may use HIEW
	or something offcourse ;) but no PE Editors or the likes of
	that...
7.	And i think that's all...
