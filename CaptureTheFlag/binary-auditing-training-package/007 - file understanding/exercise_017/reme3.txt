This one is for newer Reversers and OldLeetos alike ;)
I figured, it would be unfair to keep making my reversemes harder and harder all the time
with out giving newbie reversers some quality reversemes that they can do by themselves.

I decided to divert this reverseme to a different type of style. 

The goal of the reverseme is to add functionality by way of adding a message box. You
must make the message box display "I am a LaMe rEvErSeR! :P". Currently, the reme3.exe file
only imports and uses ExitProcess :)

Sounds easy enough, right?
*******************************************************************************************
Well then, here are the rules:
1. You must add a new section to the file by way of editing the PE header/Optional Header.

2. You must add the message box function to the file by adjusting the import table.

3. You must alter the entry point of the file to point to the message box code that is
within the new section.

4. After the execution of the message box, your code must jump back to the original 
entry point of the file. - So the program can exit nicely using the already imported
ExitProcess ;)

5. IMPORTANT: You are only allowed to change the "PE Header/Optional Header" area of the
file and the area of the new section you add. You can't change any other sections.
Especially the import area.

6. FINALLY, You are only allowed to use hex/code editors(example: HIEW), you can use Wdasm or IDA, but I don't see what good they can do. You are not pe editors like procdump or the other numerous ones, or my IID King.

7. You must do it all by hand, that is what I am trying to get at here. You must do it
all manually. No help but your brain and an editor of some kind, for changing the
hex/code.

Well, there it is folks. That shouldn't be too hard, yet not too easy. You might even
learn something. ;)
