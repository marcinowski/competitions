Your mission is to call the only function in the dll from the loader
program.  No coding your own loader.  It shouldnt be to hard.  But
of course there are a few rules.

*No touching the DLL, not in memory or anything (you really shouldnt need to)
*You can do anything to the exe, EXCEPT add any imports :)
