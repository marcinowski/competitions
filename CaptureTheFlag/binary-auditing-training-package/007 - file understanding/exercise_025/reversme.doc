 
This ReversMe on the other hand is an incomplete program (a texteditor)
with no software protection at all. It's purpose is to learn you how to 
reverse. By reversing I mean adding functionality to a program. This 
texteditor for instance has a loading option, a saving option and a an
exit option. None works. It would be nice if a texteditor had a scroll-
bar too.

This is the challenge:

- Add the loading option to the program
- Add the saving option to the program
- Add the exit option to the program
- Add a scrollbar to the editbox
