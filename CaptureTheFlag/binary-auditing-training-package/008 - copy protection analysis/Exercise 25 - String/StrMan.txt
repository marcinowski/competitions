Crudd's String Manipulator ReMe.

Origanally i wrote this to use, but decided it was pretty useless and decided to make it a reme.
Whut it does is takes a string and preforms a bit operation on it and writes it to a file.  Anyway,
on with the show.

Ok, heres the deal.  You have to make the ROR and NOT functions work.
Simple enough?  We'll there are a few rules:
	You have to add the functions in a DLL that you write.
	You cannot edit String.dll at all.
	You must make all calls to String.dll call to your DLL instead and then to String DLL.
	(NOTE: Only the two completed functions need to call String.dll, your functions can
		return to the program.  And there should be no references to String.dll in 
		the final StrMan.exe.)
	There is no need for the second edit box for the NOT function so it should be hidden or
		disabled when NOT is selected. NOTE: it needs to be re-enabled/unhidden when 
		any other radio button is selected.

Well, i hope that all makes sense.  I origanally wrote this in ASM but i was bored and decided
to try and rewrite it in C.  This is my first C program and i hope there arent any bugs.  If you
do find some please let me know.  Now go have fun reversing and send solutions or questions to:
Crudd@DrunkenBastards.com

NOTE: crtdll.dll is a file that the compiler i used (lcc) uses, i dont know if its a win9x DLL, 
so i included it to make things easier on use all.
