The task of this little, reverseme is to add some code to it.
The code you have to add will be triggered by the 'Exit' menu and should
look like this:

A messagebox should appear asking the user "Do you fickbirne really want to quit?".
Its buttons should be 'Yes' and 'No'. If the user clicks 'Yes', simply exit the
program in a clean way, if the user clicks 'No' just do NOT exit the program
(it's up to you what will happen when the user clicks 'No').

Valid solutions are solutions with a tutorial explaining what you did,
explaining the code you added and the modified binaries.
