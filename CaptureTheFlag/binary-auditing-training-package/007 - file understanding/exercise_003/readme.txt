Here comes the next reverseme of the Open & Save. The dialog is the same, but this time you won't just have to open a saved file :). The only goal you have is to make this program save and open the state of the checkboxes, but, IT HAS TO SAVE THEM IN THE EXE ITSELF ! It means that when you will run this program, it will restore the state of them when it initialises, and it won't need a savefile to restore the state. There aren't any other limitations. You can modify the exe as much as you want, you can use a vxd, you can use a dll, you can use a loader, do WHAT YOU WANT ! :).
