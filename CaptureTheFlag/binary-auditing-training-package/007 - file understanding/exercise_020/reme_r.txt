Your task is to make the reverseme to show its full commandline.
No patching is allowed (and no memory patching) and no api hooks or whatever.
.. and by the way, for a working version, windows shouldn't reboot ;-)

The reverseme is quite easy but may appear a bit hard for newbies..
Anyway, you will learn some useful stuff.
